# weatherapp

## Project Description
I created this real-time weather forecast app using weather API data, fetch commands, and asynchronous Javascript.

## Project Challeges
This was my first experience using APIs and the fetch function. Retreiving the data and getting it to display properly was probably the hardest part of this project.

## Project Lessons
I liked this project a lot. I was able to utilize a lot of new syntax such as async logic / promises, a bit of JSON, and deconstruction, but I still feel like I have barely scratched the surface of API usage. I would love to do another project diving even deeper into APIs very soon.
